# Objective:
# - Arrays; store many data points in 1 variable
# - if, elif, and else logic
# - While loops

# Arrays
# These are lists of values. The values are stored in square brackets
# and separated by a comma like this:

b = []
# This is an empty array stored in the varaible b

a = [1, 2.5, 'cat']
# This is an array with 3 element.
# the first element in an array is the zero-th element.
# if you want to print to the screen the number 1 that is stored in the array, you can refference it like this:

print(a[0])
# This says print to the screen the 0-th element in array called a.

print(a[2])
# This says print the element of array a that is in position 2. This happens to be the last position of a and it is the string 'cat'

# You can add more things to an array by using the append() function like this:

a.append('new element')
# This 'new element' is in position 3. To print it to the screen we do this:
print(a[3])

# Can you have the user input() 3 peices of information about themselves and store all that info in an array called user then print to the screen this information?
